/**
 * SECTION:plugin-openni2src
 *
 * OpenNI2 is a library to access 3D sensors such as those based on PrimeSense
 * depth sensor. Examples of such sensors are the Kinect used in Microsoft Xbox
 * consoles and Asus WAVI Xtion. Notably recordings of 3D sessions can also be
 * replayed as the original devices. See www.openni.org for more details.
 *
 * OpenNI2 can be downloaded from source, compiled and installed in Linux, Mac
 * and Windows devices(https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI2). However is better to
 * rely on Debian packages as part of the PCL library (or http://goo.gl/0o87EB).
 * More concretely on the "libopenni2-dev" and "libopenni2" packages - that can
 * be downloaded in http://goo.gl/2H6SZ6.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * Some recorded .oni files are available at <http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/1635/proj11/kinectRecord>
